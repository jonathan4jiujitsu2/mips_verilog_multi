**No, you don’t need to run that code** - it just creates a template file for manual work.

Instead, let me give you a better approach to automatically extract the operations from your model:

## Automatic Operation Extraction

```python
def extract_operations_from_model():
    """Try to extract actual operations from the model"""
    
    output_file = "C:/temp/extracted_operations.py"
    
    all_objects = oEditor.GetMatchedObjectName("*")
    
    # Find all operation results
    operation_results = []
    for obj in all_objects:
        if "SUB_" in obj:
            operation_results.append(obj)
    
    lines = []
    lines.append("# Extracted Boolean Operations")
    lines.append("")
    
    # Analyze each SUB_ object to determine the operation
    for result_obj in operation_results:
        lines.append("\n# Operation result: " + result_obj)
        
        # Parse the name to guess the operation
        # SUB_Core_L06_L07 likely means:
        # - Subtract from Core layer
        # - Using L06 and L07 as tools
        
        parts = result_obj.split("_")
        if len(parts) >= 3:
            operation = parts[0]  # "SUB"
            blank = parts[1]      # "Core" or "Prep"
            tools = "_".join(parts[2:])  # "L06_L07"
            
            # Find actual object names that match
            blank_objects = []
            tool_objects = []
            
            for obj in all_objects:
                if blank in obj and "Layer" in obj:
                    blank_objects.append(obj)
                if any(t in obj for t in tools.split("_")):
                    tool_objects.append(obj)
            
            lines.append("# Likely blank: " + str(blank_objects))
            lines.append("# Likely tools: " + str(tool_objects))
            
            # Generate the subtract command
            if blank_objects and tool_objects:
                lines.append("oEditor.Subtract([")
                lines.append("    \"NAME:Selections\",")
                lines.append("    \"Blank Parts:=\", \"" + blank_objects[0] + "\",")
                lines.append("    \"Tool Parts:=\", \"" + ",".join(tool_objects) + "\"")
                lines.append("], [")
                lines.append("    \"NAME:SubtractParameters\",")
                lines.append("    \"KeepOriginals:=\", False")
                lines.append("])")
    
    # Save the extracted operations
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write("\n".join(lines))
    
    print("Extracted operations saved to: " + output_file)
    print("\nReview and adjust the operations as needed!")

# Run this to extract operations
extract_operations_from_model()
```

## Or Use HFSS Recording (Easiest Method)

The easiest way to get the exact operations:

1. **In HFSS:**
- Go to **Tools > Record Script > Start Recording**
- Choose Python as the language
- Click on each operation in the model tree (Subtract, Unite, etc.)
- Right-click and select “Recreate” or “Edit”
- Cancel the dialog (but the script will record the operation details)
- Stop recording
1. **The recorded script will show you:**
- Exact object names involved
- Correct parameter syntax
- Proper operation order

This is much more accurate than trying to guess from the model tree names.

## Quick Check - Are Operations Needed?

To verify if the operations are essential, you can:

```python
def check_if_operations_matter():
    """Check if the model has the same objects before/after operations"""
    
    all_objects = oEditor.GetMatchedObjectName("*")
    
    # Count different object types
    base_objects = 0
    operation_results = 0
    
    for obj in all_objects:
        if "SUB_" in obj or obj.startswith("Unite"):
            operation_results += 1
        else:
            base_objects += 1
    
    print("Base objects: " + str(base_objects))
    print("Operation results: " + str(operation_results))
    
    if operation_results > 0:
        print("\nYES - Operations are essential!")
        print("The model has " + str(operation_results) + " objects created by boolean operations")
    else:
        print("\nNo operation results found")

# Check this
check_if_operations_matter()
```

The operations ARE essential for your filter - they create the actual via holes, clearances, and proper layer connections.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
